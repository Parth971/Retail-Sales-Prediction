# Retail Store Sales Prediction using Python and Machine Learning (Big-Data Analysis)

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a prediction model capable of generating actionable insights for retail store inventory management and sales/marketing planning.

## Summary
The insights generated from this project will focus on providing forecasts for sales and demand of specific products, understanding customer preferences and expectations across different product categories, and informing inventory management, stock planning, and sales/marketing strategies.

## Objectives
1. Understand the significance of emerging technologies like big data analysis and machine learning in business operations planning.
2. Develop a machine learning model capable of analyzing large volumes of retail store data and generating forecasts for product and category demand.
3. Utilize multi-linear regression techniques to create the prediction environment.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the developed model in predictive analytics.
5. Support the technical implementation with secondary analysis or research to highlight the importance of inventory planning, forecasting, and prediction in the retail industry.
6. Implement a full-stack web application to visualize store sales predictions.
7. Evaluate various tools and machine learning techniques to measure the performance of the proposed ML model.
